## Notes
- Not using classnames, react-router, sentence-case or styled-components because the requirements said no libraries
- Add integration tests with react-testing-library in a real app to test that we get redirected to the success page on submit and validation if there are errors.

Tested on node 16.10.0

- npm run start

Run tests with:

- npm run test
